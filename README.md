# cli-social-network

The purpose of this repository experiment with persistent memory and storing data in arrays by 

### getting started

### file structure
network.txt is a list of social network users seperted by a newline character. Each line is a list containing a username, password & two nested lists (statuses and friends). Lines are made up of comma seperated values in the following format:
`username, password, messages, message 1, ... message n, friends, friend 1, ... friend n,`
Note that "messages" and "friends" are string literals and are used to determine where their respective data begins in the network representation.

socialnetwork.py is the main file and executable program.

person.py is essentially a node in the social network representation containing parsed values from one line of the input file.
